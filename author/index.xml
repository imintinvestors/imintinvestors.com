      <description>Mr. IMINT is a small shareholder of Imint AB. He lives in Oslo, Norway, and has no current or prior connection to Imint AB. Mr. IMINT was probably the first to find proof about Huawei being the first smartphone customer of Vidhance products (source), which led to Imint AB disclosing the customer.
Mr. IMINT still does a lot of analysis of smartphone firmware&amp;rsquo;s that might be related to Imint AB, but is also interested in all other aspects of Imint AB.</description>
