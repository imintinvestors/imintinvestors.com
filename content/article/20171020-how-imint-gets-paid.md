title: How Imint gets Paid

Imint main business today is to licenses software to smartphone device manufacturers. The software comes preloaded in the device when the consumer buys the phone. In general Imint has not been crystal clear about all parts of the payment process and we have also been told that it actually varies from customer to customer. We will here try to piece together the puzzle of what we do know, what we can assume to be resonable and in the end speculate about the blanks in between.

Timingwise license payments can be divided into two main categories:

* Payments upfront before the device is made.
* Payments after the device is sold.

# Upfront Payments

Imint seams only selldomly to get paid before the devices are manufactured. But at least on one occation it is known that the payment for a integration project also included upfront payments for the estimated first year of sales for that device. In that case quite some engineering efforts where required as it was not a smartphone and in the end the project was halted. Getting payed upfront for a project like that seams reasonable but in general with the bulk of Imints business the payment is typically not upfront. The main reason for this is that it is alot easier to get a good price if you agree to share some of the economic risk of a producing a smartphone. As software does not have any production costs per unit it is very reasonable way of doing it.
