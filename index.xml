      <description>Det är väldigt svårt att göra prognoser i bolag som Imint. Allting förändrar sig jättefort. I denna artikel försöker vi trots det att göra gissningar om framtiden genom att göra gissningar kring priser och volymer. Det blir mycket gissningar och spekulationer. Vi ska nedan steg för steg resonera oss fram till en gissning för utfallet av Q3 som kommer att rapporteras den 24:e november. Först då vet vi hur fel dessa gissningar är.</description>

      <description>About Huawei Huawei is today the worlds biggest providers of telecommunication equipment. They are also the third biggest smartphone manufacturer selling 139.3 million units in 2016.
History With Mate 9 Huawei was the first device maker to launch a phone with Vidhance Video Stabilization. The launch was preceded by a SEK 800 thousand integration contract followed by an announcement of a license agreement. Huawei was never mentioned by name and that was still the case when Imint proudly proclaimed that there was a phone on the market that used Vidance.</description>

The finding has been confirmed by Mr Imint. The firmware contains a newer version of the Vidhance library than previous Huawei phones contained. It has more in common with the library that other Imint customers have used lately.

      <description>Imint has had quite a long journey. Development of software for smartphones actually started in 2014 as can be seen by the pre money valuations.
Imints lead investor has been PÄAB. They did their first investment in 2008 and have been leading almost every round since then up until the IPO in late 2015.
Almi Invest joined as an investor in 2010 and ended up growing their stake in Imint until they became the second biggest owner after PÄAB.</description>

      <description>Mr. IMINT is a small shareholder of Imint AB. He lives in Oslo, Norway, and has no current or prior connection to Imint AB. Mr. IMINT was probably the first to find proof about Huawei being the first smartphone customer of Vidhance products (source), which led to Imint AB disclosing the customer.
Mr. IMINT still does a lot of analysis of smartphone firmware&amp;rsquo;s that might be related to Imint AB, but is also interested in all other aspects of Imint AB.</description>

      <description>Background Getting detailed information about sales volumes for specific Huawei models is hard. Therefore this analysis is based on the overall picture for smartphone sales from Huawei Consumer Business Group, combined with relevant official communications from Huawei about sales volumes for a few specific models, where such have been obtained.
If unfamiliar with Huawei, this Fortune.com article is a good start.
The bigger picture for Huawei smartphones  2014: 75 million units shipped (source: Huawei) 2015: 108 million units shipped (source: Huawei) 2016: 139.</description>

      <title>Why Customers Pay for Integration?</title>
      <link>//imintinvestors.com/article/20170906-why-some-pay-for-integration/</link>

      <guid>//imintinvestors.com/article/20170906-why-some-pay-for-integration/</guid>
      <description>So far two (Huawei and one undisclosed chinese company.) of Imints customers have paid for a separate integration project before signing a licensing agreement. We don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly why they do it and not the others but we can always speculate:
I think the reason that some bigger guys are paying for integration projects is that they roll out their own camera software stack. That means both that they do have a team on their side to do the integration work together with and that, that team might have very special requirements on the fashion the integration is done so that it fits in with the rest of what they do with the camera.</description>
