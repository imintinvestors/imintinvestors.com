      <description>Today the Discord member Teebag got hold of an early firmware of the Huawei Mate 10 which is scheduled for announcement on the 16th of October. The finding has been confirmed by Mr Imint. The firmware contains a newer version of the Vidhance library than previous Huawei phones contained. It has more in common with the library that other Imint customers have used lately.
The firmware files have been published by a source known to deliver reliable information on Huawei firmwares in the past.</description>
