      <description>Imint has had quite a long journey. Development of software for smartphones actually started in 2014 as can be seen by the pre money valuations.
Imints lead investor has been PÄAB. They did their first investment in 2008 and have been leading almost every round since then up until the IPO in late 2015.
Almi Invest joined as an investor in 2010 and ended up growing their stake in Imint until they became the second biggest owner after PÄAB.</description>
